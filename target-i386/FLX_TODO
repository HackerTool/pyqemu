- Make PyQemu more flexible towards generic instrumentation/analysis requirements

- Redesign process management to enable separate process instrumentation

- Find/implement a solution for the shared library instrumentation problem
	1. translation cache for each process (may be a bad idea because of hot-patching)
	2. check events when they occur to see if the process did register them

- Redesign the operating system status reading interface to allow systems beyond windows XP

- Define a generic instrumentation API to allow virtual CPUs beyon i386 compatible ones
